Data analysis project on the Mint Classics Company database using the CRISP-DM methodology with SQL Workbench.
Hallo everyone
I will share the results of my project, which is data analysis for a classic car company, Mint Classics Company. In this analysis, I used the CRISP-DM method, which is a set of steps used in the data mining process.

The analysis steps I followed are as follows:
1. Business Understanding
In this stage, we need to understand the business requirements, such as goals, planning, and business strategies.
2. Data Understanding
This stage involves learning about the data format, including data collection, identifying data issues, and detecting attributes to be used.
3. Data Preparation
Data preparation is the stage where data is prepared for analysis in SQL Workbench.
4. Modeling
In this stage, we determine the mining techniques to be used based on the existing issues.
5. Evaluation
In the evaluation stage, I explain useful findings from the results of data analysis.
6. Deployment
The deployment stage involves presenting the findings obtained and provide recommendations or solutions that can be implemented in the future
